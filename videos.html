 <h1>F1 Drivers' EXTREME Physical Demand</h1>
        
               <p>Formula 1 racing is not just about speed and skill; it's also a demanding physical sport. F1 drivers face extreme physical challenges during a race: 

                <br><br><br>G-forces: Drivers experience high G-forces during acceleration, braking, and cornering, which can strain their bodies.
                <br><br>Heat: The enclosed cockpits of F1 cars can become incredibly hot, leading to dehydration and fatigue.
                <br><br>Stamina: A typical F1 race lasts for over an hour, requiring drivers to maintain focus and physical endurance throughout.
                <br><br>Precision: Controlling a high-performance F1 car requires precise movements and hand-eye coordination.
                <br><br>These factors combined make F1 racing a physically demanding sport that requires drivers to be in peak physical condition.</p>
